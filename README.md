# 2016-Stronghold

This is the code for the 2016 Stonghold Robot.

Stronghold is a medievally themed competition based on throwing 'boulders' into goals and crossing defenses. Points are awarded to each robot who crosses a defense into their opponents zone up to twice per defense.  After two crossings the defense was considered disabled. Points are also given to any robot who scores, but less point was awarded for a low goal score compared to a high goal score. After 8 goals, the tower was disabled and could be scaled. This was the operation that awarded teams the most points.

Our 2016 robot had an arm that allowed us to aim the boulders at both the high and low goal. Dual flywheels propelled the boulders with immense speed. A powerful drivetrain enabled us to cross over defenses with ease. At the end of each match, our dual piston climber allowed us to scale the tower easily.

Have fun reading through the code.
